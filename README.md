# Disno_band_NRF31512
Hacking of the Disno MagicBand Version 2 and its internal NRF31512

The "MagicRxTxBand" code will send the periodic wakeup message to nearby Bands and show any Transmitting ones around.
it is meant for an ESP32 and nRF24L01 but any other Arduino could be used.

The "NRF31512_Glitcher" code will help you with glitching and dumping an nRF31512 and compatible 8051 SoC
